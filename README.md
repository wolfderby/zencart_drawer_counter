# zencart_drawer_counter
# intended to be a simple tool to help quickly count a cash register drawer to determine how much money is in it.
# hope to expand this to calculate if cash is missing from sales receipts from previous day of payment method "cash"
#
# this is my first code collaboration/github attempt ever, be kind.
